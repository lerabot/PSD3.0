Presqu'un Sega Dreamcast is an exploration game made with processing.
Simply put, it loads OBJ as 3d Environnement and let you move around them using the WASD pattern.
It also feature a simply communication method to an arduino using the Serial library.
The arduino is used for a (not implemented yet) joystick controller and a (implemented and working) 20x4 HD44780 LCD screen.
The screen is used to display all the text (dialogue / though / observation) in the game.


**Current Version**: 3.0 is stable, and let you move around the first map.

**Beta Version**: 4.0 adds a snowstorm class, and the second map. It's currently being worked on.
