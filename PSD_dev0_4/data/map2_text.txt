Was it really 
this far?

That's where
the fire was a
couple year ago.

Ah, good ol'
tractor.

//l'extension pour le bois
This was built
recently. I don't 
remember this.

//porte garage
Still messy inside,
in a good way.

//porte garage 2
I thought I saw
him get inside,
where is he?

//porte devant
This one is always
locked, he usually
goes by the side
door.

//porte cot√©
Ah! It's locked.
He usually has
a key around.
Where is it?

//clef
The key's supposed
to be up here,
somewhere

//clef 2
Hum... 
Can't find it.
