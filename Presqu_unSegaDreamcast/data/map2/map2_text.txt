#1 intro
-10229.522, -104.28473, -1671.9253
Was it really 
this far?

#2 feu
-1923.4622, -70.32409, -2001.5834
That's where
the fire was a
couple year ago.


#3 tracteur
49.625732, -103.20639, 2151.5952
Ah, good ol'
tractor.


#4 l'extension pour le bois
1508.01, -105.69401, 2242.0723
This was built
recently. I don't 
remember this.

#5 porte garage

Still messy inside,
in a good way.

#6 porte garage 2
595.8844, -92.01877, 2853.566
I thought I saw
him get inside,
where is he?

#6 porte devant
379.27197, -99.23801, 3598.6294
This one is always
locked, he usually
goes by the side
door.

#7 porte cot√©
557.83984, -91.78903, 4811.422
Ah! It's locked.
He usually has
a key around.
Where is it?

#8 clef
599.6902, -88.89831, 5323.166
The key's supposed
to be up here,
somewhere

//////clef 2
Hum... 
Can't find it.

# voisin arriere
1730.6615, -100.26539, 6762.0015
The fence splits 
my grandpa land
from this other guy
place.
His home is nowhere
to be seen. My granddad
isn't to talkative
about that either. 

# buggy
3685.38, -88.02633, 4214.167
My dad had one
of these buggy they
made with car engine.
   
They used to
spend so much time building
those with his brother
and cousin. 
   
At some point, his
sister and him crashed
with the thing in the wood.
    
My granddad heard the
sound and thought the
worse.
   
That was their last buggy.




# tarp
3757.8213, -79.58872, 2506.943
Probably another
snowmobile or
broken machine.




# snowmobile
3301.1768, -75.680084, 3155.2124
Because you need
30 year old
snowmobiles around.

# un peu loin
3820.4937, -71.49163, -1175.1107
Where's the old
treehouse? I can
see the forest, but
not the treehouse.
